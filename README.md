JWT Token Authentication API with ASP.NET 8, MongoDB, Docker, and Swagger

Introduction

This project demonstrates the implementation of a secure JWT token-based authentication API using ASP.NET 8, MongoDB, Docker, and Swagger. It provides a robust and well-structured approach to user authentication for web applications.

Key Features

JWT Token Authentication: Implements a secure JWT token authentication mechanism for protecting API endpoints.
User Management: Enables user registration, login, and retrieval (with authorization).
MongoDB Integration: Utilizes MongoDB as the database for storing user data.
Dockerization: Provides a containerized environment for easy deployment and scalability.
Hosted Service: Leverages a hosted service for initialization tasks, such as creating initial users.
Swagger Integration: Offers interactive API documentation through Swagger for enhanced developer experience.
Technologies Used

C# (programming language)
ASP.NET 8 (web framework)
MongoDB (NoSQL database)
Docker (containerization platform)
JwtSecurityTokenHandler (for JWT token handling)
Microsoft.OpenApi.Models (for Swagger integration)
